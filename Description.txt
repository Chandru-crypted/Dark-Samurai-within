Dark Samurai Within

I am making a simple game where you would ask for the name and the user should 
enter his name.
for example let the user enter the name "chan".
then the game would start and he will be presented with 3 blocks in which 
one will
contain the first character of his name
And the user should press 1 or 2 or 3 according the location in which the 
character is present. If he pressed the correct location number he will be 
put up with next 3 blocks in which one will contain the next character in his 
name provided.

#--------- An example ---------#
 _____    
|     |   
|  c  |   [1]
|_____|



 _____    
|     |
|  k  |  [2]
|_____|



 _____    
|     |
|  q  |  [3]
|_____|

# --------------------------- #


And the same thing will continue with till all the characters in his name is 
completed.

In the future: 
0) A story board will be made which will be featuring this proverb 
"If there is no enemy within, the enemy outside can do us no harm " and involves 
a samurai.
1) We will make this game more tough by introducing our own random characters
, that the user has to remember correctly with the correct order and has to play 
this game.
2) Addind a score card - The user will be tested on the responisveness of his input. We will try to 
measure in milli seconds the time he takes to respond.
